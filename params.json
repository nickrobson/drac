{"name":"Drac","tagline":"Dracula's back, and he's mad.","body":"# drac\r\nA python implementation of the *incredibly* popular Fury of Dracula game.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n##### How do I launch the game?\r\nYou can launch it from the `drac.py` file, from console or otherwise. I'm working out a better way.\r\n\r\n##### How can I make this work how I want it to?\r\nSee the `drac_config.py` file? That's drac's config. Use it wisely.\r\n\r\n##### How do I play this glorious thing?\r\nUse the config to change drac's mode:\r\n* **Plays**, **Turns**: The program's first argument is the past plays string.\r\n* **Interactive**: Just run `drac.py`, it will greet you with the interactive menu.\r\n* **Networked**: WIP. Client-server system according to `drac_config.py`, allowing network play.\r\n* **Pygame**: WIP. Graphical representation of the game using the pygame module.\r\n* **AI Mode**: WIP. Allows AI modules to be used to battle it out.\r\n\r\n##### Why did you decide this was a good idea?\r\nCOMP1927's second assessment is/was doing this in C, and I decided to do it in Python too, as a side project.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n* Nick Robson: Programming\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\ndrac is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n\r\n| **Required** | **Permitted** | **Forbidden** |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Disclose Source              | Commercial Use | Hold Liable  |\r\n| License and copyright notice | Distribution   | Sublicensing |\r\n| Network Use is Distribution  | Modification   | |\r\n| State Changes                | Patent Grant   | |\r\n|                              | Private Use    | |\r\n\r\nThis means modifications:\r\n* must be open source (Source Code is publically available)\r\n* must include the same LICENSE (use AGPL v3)\r\n* must provide full software access (including Source Code) to anyone using the software via network\r\n* must explicitly state changes between the modification and the original software\r\n\r\nPlease see the provided LICENSE file for more information.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
